# caide
Automates certain common tasks that you do during programming competitions:
parsing, running and debugging problem tests, inlining library code.

caide is inspired by such projects as
[chelper](https://code.google.com/p/idea-chelper) or
[jhelper](https://github.com/AlexeyDmitriev/JHelper). Its purpose is to
automate the following tasks:

* Parsing problem statement and extracting test cases
* Generating solution scaffold
* Inlining library code and preparing a single source file for submission
* Running the tests on your solution
* Debugging the tests

Unlike other projects, caide is designed to support multiple programming
languages and IDEs/editors.
